        <h2>We Haven't Forgotten</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since first female mayor of West St. Paul Jenny Thompson
          Halverson said, “This won’t be forgotten, folks” after blowing the
          whistle on a whole lot of bad, misogynistic behavior during her time
          on city council and as mayor, WoW has made it a goal to increase civic
          engagement, make room for women, non-binary, and other
          underrepresented folks at the decision-making table, and make West St.
          Paul a more progressive place to work, live, and play.
        </p>

        <p>
          May 18, 2018 marked a historic meeting: Hundreds of West St. Paul
          citizens came to support the mayor, denounce both situational and
          systemic sexism and other city-wide issues, and rally for change in
          our city. Each year we kick off our hygiene drive in May to remember
          to advance our causes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We raise money and collect products such as tampons, pads, and cups to
          help our menstruating neighbors get the supplies they need. We’ve
          changed the way we raise money and collect products each year based on
          need and safety protocols.
        </p>

        <h2>Drive-By Tampon Drive 2021</h2>
        <p>
          We’ll have a variety of safe ways to donate, drop off, or otherwise
          participate in this year’s drive.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>May 18:</strong> Drive Kickoff Day</li>
          <li>
            <strong>May 24:</strong> Announcement during the citizen comments
            portion of the West St. Paul City Council meeting.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We will take product and donation drop-offs at the meeting and outside
          afterward (approximately 6:30-7:30 p.m.).
          <em>
            Please follow social distancing, masking, and safety guidelines.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>Watch this space for fun dropoff options!</p>

        <h3>Drive-By Pickups</h3>
        <p>
          To facilitate our drive-by pickups for products this year, we have
          built a texting service that you can communicate with to let us know
          when and where to pick up your donation.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you would like us to pickup your donation from your doorstep,
          <strong>text 'Donate' to (651) 359-9277</strong>. From there, the
          automated system we built will walk you through the rest. It's free
          and easy, although standard text messaging rates may apply.
        </p>

        <p>As of now, we’ll have drive-bys on the following dates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>June 3rd</strong> from 6-8 p.m.</li>
          <li><strong>June 13th</strong> from 9-11 a.m.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Gets the Products?</h2>

        <p>
          This year, we will be donating all the proceeds from our fundraiser—we
          don’t take a dime—to our rock-solid local partner, Neighbors, Inc. as
          well as our new partner this year, District 197 schools, who both
          regularly raise the alarm that they do not have enough to meet demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Did you know? Hygiene products such as pads, tampons, cups, and such
          are among the highest-demand products at food banks and other
          organizations who work with communities to help meet their daily
          needs. Volunteers at Neighbors, Inc. told WoW they often have to open
          the boxes and break them apart to try to give clients a few each and
          stretch the donations. When we donated to mutual aid groups in the
          wake of the murder of George Floyd, we were received with extremely
          excited faces and arms and told our products flew off the tables.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ve been really successful in getting the word out and helping our
          neighbors—and we’re nowhere near stopping. We try to top our efforts
          each year. Help us!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Our first year:</strong> We raised $2,625 and donated 141
            pounds of tampons, pads, and cups (Trust us, that’s a lot. A
            truckload!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Our second year:</strong> About $900 in a one-night
            fundraiser, plus another truckload of product
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Our third year:</strong> $5,250, plus donated product (which
            didn’t get weighed or measured due to COVID and variety of delivery
            methods)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every penny has always gone toward products. This is an all-volunteer
          operation.
        </p>

        <h2>Take My Money!</h2>

        <p>
          Want to just drop us some cash and not worry about the rest? We’re
          skipping an online fundraiser so we can funnel the very mostest money
          to the people who need it, so we’re taking a cue from mutual aid
          movements to drop cash to purchase products.
